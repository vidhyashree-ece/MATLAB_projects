**Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**

FIR & IIR filter design (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.)
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation
Signal convolution and correlation

**Communication System**

Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM)
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) and Delta Modulation (DM)
Error detection and correction techniques

**Wireless Communication**

MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems
OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) simulation
Channel estimation and equalization techniques
ðŸ“‚ **File Formats**: MATLAB .m script files with relevant documentation.

ðŸ”— How to Use: Clone the repository and run the scripts in MATLAB.
